# SnakesAndLaddersC
I created Snakes and Ladders in C as a college project.
Markup : 
* What does this include?
* Random Snake and Ladder Placement.
* Checks to ensure that the rules of the game aren't compromised (such as a ladder climbing to a snake).
* Multiple saving options.
* Reference file with custom save names.
* Support for Multiple Players.
* ENDLESS FUN THROUGH THE CLASSIC GAME OF SNAKES AND LADDERS!

If I were to return to this, it would be to split things into multiple header files
to improve the readability of the project.
